# Future design potential

The aim of our app was to connect people in a community with the services that they need.Our App will change how people get help when in need. It will be as easy as touching a button sitting at home and the help will arrive at the doorstep. When a user uses our app they do not have to step out of their home to buy necessary items when they can't or services that they can afford. Instead volunteers will come to thier home. A long term possibility could be that our features could be integrated with telemedicine. This will benefit people as it will save time and a one-stop for all medical and necessary things. The app features could also be integrated with established services to provide food to the people. The app could help the people and we can incorporate this to any service that is needed.
