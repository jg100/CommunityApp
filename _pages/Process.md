# The Design Process

## 3 States of Prototping

### 1. Inspire: Wireframe and storyboard
* Stroyboard:
![stroyboard](/assets/process/storybord.jpg)
This mother has many kids at home and the refrigerator is empty. She is not able to go outside to buy some groceries because the kids are too much trouble. Thus, she use CommunityApp to send a help request. A neighbor is on Target right now and accepts the request. When the neighbor come home, he also delivered the groceries to this mother.

The Storyboard is tell us how the App will be used. Then, We create the wireframes of the app base on the data we found and the storyboard.

* Wireframes
We use figma to create wireframes.

### 2. Evole: Hi-fidelity prototype

Stage 2 is to translate the wireframes into prototypes.
We use Figma to finish the flow of the interaction, content, and color and to make it like a real App

We can use the Hi-fidelity prototype the play around with the app. It's also important for conducting the next stage of the iterate on prototype and Usability testing.

### 3. Validate: Iterate on prototype

####  UI Inspection
We use Heuristic Evaluation to help us to find the usability problems in a design

The data we found:

Then, we follow these problems and recommendations to revise the prototype

#### Usability Testing

We found 10 participants and gave them tasks to try on the prototype. Then, we observed them do the task and noted what happened when they were doing the task on the prototype.

Here is our notes:

After We revised the prototype by usability testing, the final prototype came out.

It is the Whole process we design the Application.
