# What we found
An updated improved version of your Milestone 2 submission that showcases the analysis that you did, the categories you found (the findings) and what that means for potential design.

The data that we collected in our research was done via direct person to person interviews. The interviews conducted were done on a wide range of ages and backgrounds. The youngest participant being 22 years old and the oldest being in their 50’s. The main subject of discussions surrounded the purpose and use of delivery applications. What we found was that many younger people did in fact use delivery applications but it was mainly rooted in convenience. The young individuals that did not use delivery applications did not use them because they found it too expensive. On the other side of the spectrum, when looking at older populations the biggest reason they haven’t used delivery apps was because the interfaces were too small or complex for them to feel comfortable to use the platforms.

From our research we also found that people increasingly used delivery apps during the pandemic and some of those habits continued even after things began to reopen. These findings helped us refine our goals to harness the power of delivery and service networks in order to foster a community that was so lacking during the pandemic, where it truly felt like everyone was out for themselves.
