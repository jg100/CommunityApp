# About the App Story

The problem that our app hoped to achieve is multi pronged. We want to be able to connect people in a community with the services that they need while also creating close ties amongst people in a community.

The problem that we have identified and hope to solve is the lack of community partnership around the world. At the height of the pandemic it truly felt like everyone was really in it for themselves. Certain communities across the world pool together their resources to not only better themselves but also better the people around them. Communities should be built on a foundation of togetherness and teamwork, it is in fact the only way the human race has survived for so long. However, the unique independent culture of the West which fosters independence over community tends to overshadow the true benefits of community. 

This problem matters because of the implications that the lack of community has on individuals and large sets of populations. Because of the Westâ€™s emphasis on independence individuals have lost a sense of empathy amongst each other. It is important for people to work together in a way that betters everyone's situation while also giving people the opportunity to volunteer.
